<h2>The Interests of Austin Henderson</h2>
<p> Hello, I'm Austin Henderson, an 18 year old finance major at the University of Georgia. Born in Smyrna, Georgia, I have always been a bulldog fan and being able to come to this school has been a dream come true.
My first year here at UGA has been fantastic and I can't believe it's almost over!
One of my biggest hobbies is sports and my favorite sports to play/watch are football, baseball and basketball. Here is a table of my favorite teams for these three sports at both the collegiate and professional level:</p>
<h4>My favorite sports teams</h4>

<p>However, when I was 18 months old, I was diagnosed with Coates Disease, a disease that 
caused the retina in my right eye to dettach, thus causing me to go blind in my right eye.
Because of this, I could never play contact sports when I was younger, therefore, I fell in love with the sport of bowling.
However, leading up to my college years, I lost that love I had with bowling and now a days, I rarely ever bowl competitively anymore. 
After reflecting on the 13 years that I bowled competively, as in national tournaments and simple leagues, I finally understand the true reason why I bowled.
I bowled because it gave me an opportunity to feel normal, normal as in the ability to play sports 
since I was never able to play the most basic fundamental sports that most kids got to enjoy.</p>

<h2>My Intended Major at UGA</h2>
<p> When applying to UGA, I applied to be an intended civil engineering major. However, half way through the summer, I changed my mind and decided I wanted to major 
in Finance. I decided to change my major because I no longer had any interest in engineering after my advanced Physics class in my senior year of highschool.
Yes I still love physics, however, I wouldn't want to do that for the rest of my life. Thus, I had a change in mind and decided that I wanted to do Finance.
Math has always came somewhat natural to me and I loved Economics in highschool, thus Finance gives me an alternative to further my studies in both areas. Too, I was really impressed with all I've heard
about Terry here at UGA and that definitely aided me in wanting to go the Finance. As of today, I have no idea which route in Finance I want to take, however, I know i will chose the right one!</p>
